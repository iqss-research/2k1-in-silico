DGP,intro,Intro,"On this tab, we know everything. We set up a Data Generating Process (DGP), and then create data from it.
Using this tab will help you understand the probability model of the world, and learn about specific families of DGPs - distributions - that social scientists frequently use.",NA
DGP,intro,DGP Selection,"Choose a family of data generating processes. The tab is currently set up with the Normal distribution, a very common and very useful family.",#distrIDDiv
DGP,intro,Probability Model,"This is the Probability Model of this family of DGPs, describing how parameters become data. ",#distrTex
DGP,intro,PDF,"This is the Probability Density Function (PDF), describing which Y values are more likely given the paramaters and covariates.",#pdfTex
DGP,intro,params,Reparametrizing is the process by which we turn covariates - X - into an intermediate parameter - mu - which we can then use in the PDF.,#paramTexTut
DGP,intro,indep,A crucial assumption - that each row of Y is generated independently from every other row.,#indepTex
DGP,intro,Observation Choice,Decide how much data you want to generate.,#obsSlider
DGP,intro,X Choice,"In the same way we may think that income depends on education, the output of this DGP - Y - depends on its covariates.",#xChoiceCol
DGP,intro,X Choice 1,"Choose a covariate. The covariates are fixed, generated according to specified distributions.",#xChoice1Div
DGP,intro,Add X,Add another covariate. You'll have another parameter to choose.,#addXVar
DGP,intro,Sliders,"These sliders let you choose parameters. They'll combine with the covariates in the way the Probability model describes. This slider lets you pick a constant term, which will move the mean of the DGP around.",#paramSliderDiv1
DGP,intro,Sliders 2,"This slider chooses a coefficient, that changes how the first covariate affects the DGP. You can see how in the bottom right plot. ",#paramSliderDiv2
DGP,intro,Sliders S,This is a slider for a special parameter that determines the dispersion of data drawn from the DGP: how far the average data point is from the mean.,#paramSliderDivS
DGP,intro,Analytical Distr,"Here, you can see a graphical representation of the DGP you have set up, based on your choices of parameters and covariates. 
This isn't randomly generated! It comes from the PDF. But if you randomly generated more and more data, the histogram of that data would look more and more like this. ",#distPlotDiv
DGP,intro,Hist of parameter,"This describes the intermediate parameter, which is generated based on your parameters combined with the covariates. In this case, this is mu.",#probHistPlotDiv
DGP,intro,Functional Form,"The relationship between your chosen parameter and the rest of the parameters, with all else held equal,",#FFPlotDiv
DGP,intro,Data ,This is the data you've generated from the DGP.,#outcomeDisplayP
DGP,intro,Outro,"Now that you've seen how it works, try changing the parameters and see how the DGP and your data change.
On the next tab, we'll treat this data as if we don't know where it came from, and use it to learn about inference.",NA
MLE,intro,Intro,"On this tab we aren't omniscient any more. In fact, all we know is the data you made on the last tab. We have to make inferences about the true DGP.",NA
MLE,intro,Model Selection,"We can look at our data, or consult theory, and select a model that's our best guess of the true DGP. Maybe I'll guess that this data came from a Stylized Normal distribution. ",#assumedDistrIDDiv
MLE,intro,Assumed Covariate,"Choose a covariate. The covariates are fixed, generated according to specified distributions. A researcher might hypothesize that some observed data - income - is attributable to one or more covariates - education, parents' incomes, etc",#assumedXChoice1Div
MLE,intro,Add X Assumed,Add another assumed covariate. You'll have another parameter to choose.,#addXVarAssumed

MLE,intro,Outro,"On the next tab, we can go from trying to estimate the properties of the DGP to extrapolating from our estimate. This is the best way to find many more quantities of interest. For example, if I've estimated a DGP for income, I can then ask ""Given someone has 10 years of education, what's the probability they'll make more than the median income?""",NA
