Intro,intro,Intro,"<h2>The Big Picture of 2k1 in Silico</h2>
<p>an app by <a href = ""https://garyking.org"">Gary King</a> and <a href = ""https://zagrebmukerjee.com"">Zagreb Mukerjee</a>
<p>Much of empirical social science is based on statistical inference: the art of using what we can observe to learn about what we can't. 
This app will guide you through the intuition of inference without being distracted by having to learn a programming language.
The fundamental concepts of inference will help you understand the methods currently in use, as well as all the new methods that will be discovered over the 
course of your scientific career.</p>

<p>These fundamental concepts fall into three categories:</p>
<ul style = ""padding-left:25px;"">
<li><b>Data Generation Processes</b>, and how to represent them using the language of <b>Probability</b>;</li>
<li><b>Likelihood</b>, a framework for making inferences, and describing how certain we are about them;</li>
<li>and <b>Simulation</b>, a technique to extend specific inference results to broader implications about the world</li>
</ul>

<p>The app parallels core content of <a href=""https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/gov2001/"">Gov 2001</a>, Harvard's introductory quantitative methods class for political scientists.
If you want to go deeper into any of the concepts presented here, the app offers links to Gov 2001 lecture videos, slides, or other materials.
For example, <a href=""https://youtu.be/qs2uCuDL2OQ?t=2416"">this lecture video</a> presents the big picture of inference in greater detail.

DGP,intro,DGPs and Probability,"On this tab, you can use the <b>Probability Model</b> to set up a <b>Data Generating Process</b>, change its parameters, and see how it reacts. Using this tab will help you develop an intuition for probability, parameters, and distributions."
MLE,intro,Inference and Likelihood,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P79af1fkUsk"">this video</a> give an overview of the problem of inference."
Sim,intro,Simulation, <b>Simulation</b> is a tool for using inferences to gain broader and more useful knowledge.
DGP,intro,DGP Choice,"Choose a family of <b>Data Generating Processes</b>. Each family consists of many members who share a probability model, but have different parameters"
DGP,intro,Probability Model,"<p>This is the Probability Model of this family of DGPs, describing how parameters become data. It consists of:</p><ul><li>A <b>Probability Density Function</b>, which turns parameters and covariates into outcomes</li><li>A <b>systematic component</b> describing how parameters are set</li><li>A crucial <b>independence assumption</b> which lets us randomly generate outcomes one at a time</li></ul>"
DGP,intro,Observation Choice,Decide how much data you want to generate.
DGP,intro,Covariates,"<p>The outcome variable of this DGP - Y - depends on its <b>covariates</b>. These are random variables that, with the parameters, combine into Y as described by the Probability Model. In this case, we\'ve generated the covariates randomly beforehand, according to various DGPs. You can go <a href=""https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/2k1-in-silico/x-values"">here</a> to see the covariate choices. </p><p>Use the buttons to add or remove covariates.</p>"
DGP,intro,Parameters,"These sliders let you choose parameters. Depending on the DGP, these will directly control the shape of the distribution that you see in the <i>Analytical Plot</i>, or combine with the parameters first (as described in the Probability Model)."
DGP,intro,Analytical Plot,"<p>Here, you can see a graphical representation of the DGP you have set up, based on your choices of parameters and covariates. </p><p>This is a <b>density</b> or <b>mass</b> plot. It comes from the Probability Model - it isn\'t randomly generated! But if you randomly generated more and more data, the histogram of that data would look more and more like this. </p>"
DGP,intro,Ordinal Plot,The relative probability of each of the values as the chosen covariate changes.
DGP,intro,Parameter Histogram,"This plot describes the intermediate parameter, which is generated based on your parameters combined with the covariate."
DGP,intro,Functional Form,"The relationship between your chosen parameter and the rest of the parameters, with all the other parameters held at their means."
DGP,intro,Randomly Generated Data,"<p>Here is the data you\'ve generated from the DGP. Try changing parameters, and see how it changes.</p> <p>On the <i>Model</i> tab, we\'ll treat this data as if we don\'t know where it came from, and use it to learn about inference.</p>"
MLE,intro,Data for Inference,"Now we are going to treat our data as if we didn\'t know the DGP, and use inference to try and guess it. "
MLE,intro,Model Selection,"You can look at our data, or consult theory, and select a model that\'s our best guess of the true DGP. Of course, in this app, you know the DGP (look at the top bar, if you've forgotten!). But try changing the model, and see how the prediction process works."
MLE,intro,Hypothesize a Covariate,"<p>Hypothesize a covariate. A researcher might hypothesize that some observed data - income - is attributable to one or more covariates - education, parents\' incomes, etc.  The covariates are generated randomly beforehand, according to various DGPs. You can go <a href=""https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/2k1-in-silico/x-values"">here</a> to see the covariate choices. </p><p>Use the buttons to add or remove covariates.</p>"
MLE,intro,Statistical Model,"This is the statistical model, describing the family of models we chose. We\'re going to look at different parameter values - different members of this family - until we find the best fit."
MLE,intro,Guesstimate,"With this, you can approximate likelihood inference by hand. Try moving the sliders around until the green line (your DGP guess) matches the blue bars, as best as you can get. Hit the button to set the sliders to the maximum likelihood estimates."
MLE,intro,Guesstimate Plot,"The choice of model determines how you\'re going to be able to move the green line. If you\'ve chosen the wrong model, this could be a diagnostic. Suppose you choose a Stylized Normal to model Normally-distributed data. Then, the data might be more or less dispersed than you can capture with this plot. This sort of error is called <i>misspecification</i>."
MLE,intro,Likelihood,"Now let\'s formalize our guessing process. We want to know which member of our family of DGPs is most likely to have generated our data. To do that, we choose the potential parameter values that maximize a likelihood function (specifically, the log of the likelihood function, for computational reasons). This is the function to maximize."
MLE,intro,MLE plot,"<b>Maximum Likelihood Estimation</b> - like the name suggests - involves picking the parameter value that maximizes the log-likelihood function. The highest point on this plot tells us which parameters are most likely. If the plot is very flat near its peak, that means other parameter values are almost as likely,so we're not as sure of our estimate. If the plot is very pointed, that indicates more certainty. This is captured in the standard error, which is derived from the curvature of the log-likelihood at its peak."
MLE,intro,FFL plot,A plot of the functional form of our assumed DGP.
MLE,intro,Estimates,"The final output of our maximum likelihood estimation. The first part is a point estimate: our best guess for the real &beta;, given our assumed model. The second part is an estimate of uncertainty, reflecting how sure we are about that guess - were other values of &beta; nearly as likely?"
Sim,intro,Estimates (Sim),"Here\'s our starting point: the point estimates you made before, with an estimated uncertainty around them. "
Sim,intro,QOI picker,"Use this dropdown to choose a quantity of interest. Maybe I want to choose a value of X, and see what range of values of Y are possible; or maybe I want to guess what would happen if I re-drew this sample 1,000 times and plotted the estimates of &mu;."
Sim,intro,Sim X,"This slider lets you pick X. Before, we were using covariates to estimate our model. We have estimated the model. Maybe I estimated the relationship of vote share to advertising. Now I can ask, ""Given a certain level of advertising expenditure, how much vote share can I expect to gain - and how certain can I be about that?"""
Sim,intro,Sim Est Uncertainty,"There are two kinds of uncertainty to represent with simulation. The first is the <i>estimation uncertainty</i>. We\'re only observing a small sample of our population, or of the population of potential outcomes. How sure are we that our estimator is close to the true value?"
Sim,intro,Sim Fundamental Uncertainty,"The second type of uncertainty is <i>fundamental uncertainty</i>, representing the fact that the world is uncertain. Even if I got my parameter exactly right, I would only know how much my advertising spend would change my vote share in expectation. I can\'t predict whether it will rain in my best precincts, or if my opponents will pull out an October surprise. We simulate to represent those sort of surprises."
Sim,intro,QOI plot,"Here\'s the distribution of the quantity of interest you picked. The histogram represents the results of 1,000 simulations. In this case, it represents predicted values that Y can take on given the X you picked, and the estimation and fundamental uncertainty."
Sim,intro,FF plot,"This plot shows us one perspective on our estimation uncertainty. Given different covariate values, the line shows us the expected value of &mu;, and the band shows us the 80% confidence interval around the blue line. "
