DGP,intro,Intro,"On this tab, we know everything. We set up a Data Generating Process (DGP), and then create data from it.
Using this tab will help you understand the probability model of the world, and learn about specific families of DGPs - distributions - that social scientists frequently use.",NA
DGP,intro,DGP Choice,"Choose a family of <b>Data Generating Processes</b>. Each family consists of many members who share a probability model, but have different parameters",#distrIDDiv
DGP,intro,Probability Model,"<p>This is the Probability Model of this family of DGPs, describing how parameters become data. It consists of:</p><ul><li>A <b>Probability Density Function</b>, which turns parameters and covariates into outcomes</li><li>A <b>systematic component</b> describing how parameters are set</li><li>A crucial <b>independence assumption</b> which lets us randomly generate outcomes one at a time</li></ul>",#distrTex
DGP,intro,Observation Choice,Decide how much data you want to generate.,#obsSlider
DGP,intro,X Choice,"The outcome variable of this DGP - Y - depends on its <b>covariates</b>. These are random variables that, with the parameters, combine into Y as described by the Probability Model. In this case, we've generated the covariates randomly beforehand, according to various DGPs.",#xChoiceCol
DGP,intro,Parameters,"These sliders let you choose parameters. Depending on the DGP, these will directly control the shape of the distribution that you can see in the <i>Analytical Plot</i>, or combine with the parameters first (as described in the Probability Model).",#paramSliderDiv1
DGP,intro,Analytical Plot,"<p>Here, you can see a graphical representation of the DGP you have set up, based on your choices of parameters and covariates. </p><p>This is a <b>density</b> or <b>mass</b> plot. It comes from the Probability Model - it isn't randomly generated! But if you randomly generated more and more data, the histogram of that data would look more and more like this. </p>",#distPlotDiv
DGP,intro,Parameter Histogram,"This plot describes the intermediate parameter, which is generated based on your parameters combined with the covariate.",#probHistPlotDiv
DGP,intro,Functional Form,"The relationship between your chosen parameter and the rest of the parameters, with all the other parameters held at their means.",#FFPlotDiv
DGP,intro,Randomly Generated Data,"<p>Here is the data you've generated from the DGP. Try changing parameters, and see how it changes.</p> <p>On the <i>Model</i> tab, we'll treat this data as if we don't know where it came from, and use it to learn about inference.</p>",#outcomeDisplayP
MLE,intro,Intro,"On this tab we aren't omniscient any more. In fact, all we know is the data you made on the last tab. We have to make inferences about the true DGP.",#outcomeDisplayL
MLE,intro,Model Selection,"We can look at our data, or consult theory, and select a model that's our best guess of the true DGP. Maybe I'll guess that this data came from a Stylized Normal distribution. ",#assumedDistrSelectCol
MLE,intro,Assumed Covariate,"Hypothesize a covariate. The covariates are fixed, generated according to specified distributions. A researcher might hypothesize that some observed data - income - is attributable to one or more covariates - education, parents' incomes, etc",#assumedXChoice1Div
MLE,intro,Add X Assumed,Add another covariate to your model. You'll have another parameter to choose.,#addXVarAssumed
MLE,intro,Statistical Model,"This is the statistical model, describing the family of models we chose. We're going to look at different parameter values - different members of this family - until we find the best fit",#statModelRow
MLE,intro,Guesstimate,"With this, you can approximate likelihood inference by hand. Try moving the sliders around until the green line (your DGP guess) matches the blue bars, as best as you can get.",#guesstimateCol
MLE,intro,Reset ,Set the guesstimate to the Maximum Likelihood Estimates - the algorithmic best guess.,#resetByHand
MLE,intro,byhand plot,"The guesstimate is going to be tough to get right, because the true DGP is a normal distribution. We're trying to fit a stylized normal distribution with the variance fixed at one. This sort of mistake is called <i>misspecification</i>",#byHandPlotDiv
MLE,intro,Likelihood,Now let's formalize our guessing process. We've turned the statistical model into a likelihood function. We can use this to ask - which member of our family of DGPs is most likely to have generated our data?,#likelihoodRow
MLE,intro,MLE plot,"This plot comes from the Log Likelihood function. It shows us the likelihood curve, which illustrates the relative likelihood of different values of the parameter &beta;.",#MLEPlotDiv
MLE,intro,FFL plot,A plot of the functional form of our assumed DGP.,#FFLPlotDiv
MLE,intro,Estimates,"The final output of our maximum likelihood estimation. The first part is a point estimate: our best guess for the real &beta;, given our assumed model. The second part is an estimate of uncertainty, reflecting how sure we are about that guess - were other values of &beta; nearly as likely?",#estimatesRow
MLE,intro,Outro,"On the next tab, we can go from trying to estimate the properties of the DGP to extrapolating from our estimate. This is the best way to find many more quantities of interest. For example, if I've estimated a DGP for income, I can then ask ""Given someone has 8 years of education, what's the probability they'll fall below the poverty line?""",NA
Sim,intro,Intro,"This tab lets us interpret the estimates we got from MLE. &beta; is not always our real quantity of interest. Why not decide what we actually want to know, and go look at that?",NA
Sim,intro,Estimates (Sim),"Here's our starting point: the point estimates you made before, with an estimated uncertainty around them. ",#simEstimatesRow
Sim,intro,QOI picker,"Use this dropdown to choose a quantity of interest. Maybe I want to choose a value of X, and see what range of values of Y are possible; or maybe I want to guess what would happen if I re-drew this sample 1,000 times and plotted the estimates of &mu;.",#QOIPickerDiv
Sim,intro,Sim X,"This slider lets you pick X. Before, we were using covariates to estimate our model. We have estimated the model. Maybe I estimated the relationship of vote share to advertising. Now I can ask, ""Given a certain level of advertising expenditure, how much vote share can I expect to gain - and how certain can I be about that?""",#simSliderDiv1
Sim,intro,Sim Est Uncertainty,"There are two kinds of uncertainty to represent with simulation. The first is the <i>estimation uncertainty</i>. We're only observing a small sample of our population, or of the population of potential outcomes. How sure are we that our estimator is close to the true value?",#simEstimationDiv
Sim,intro,Sim Fundamental Uncertainty,"The second type of uncertainty is <i>fundamental uncertainty</i>, representing the fact that the world is uncertain. Even if I got my parameter exactly right, I would only know how much my advertising spend would change my vote share in expectation. I can't predict whether it will rain in my best precincts, or if my opponents will pull out an October surprise. We simulate to represent those sort of surprises.",#simFundamentalDiv
Sim,intro,QOI plot,"Here's the distribution of the quantity of interest you picked. The histogram represents the results of 1,000 simulations. In this case, it represents predicted values that Y can take on given the X you picked, and the estimation and fundamental uncertainty.",#QOIPlotDiv
Sim,intro,FF plot,"This plot shows us one perspective on our estimation uncertainty. Given different covariate values, the line shows us the expected value of &mu;, and the band shows us the 80% confidence interval around the blue line. ",#FFSimplotDiv
