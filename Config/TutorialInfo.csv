DGP,intro,DGPs and Probability,<b>Probability</b> is a model we use to think about uncertainty in <b>Data Generating Processes</b>.
MLE,intro,Inference and Likelihood,<b>Likelihood</b> is a tool for conducting <b>inference</b> - using what we do know to gain knowledge about what we don\'t.
Sim,intro,Simulation, <b>Simulation</b> is a tool for using inferences to gain broader and more useful knowledge.
DGP,intro,DGP Choice,"Choose a family of <b>Data Generating Processes</b>. Each family consists of many members who share a probability model, but have different parameters"
DGP,intro,Probability Model,"<p>This is the Probability Model of this family of DGPs, describing how parameters become data. It consists of:</p><ul><li>A <b>Probability Density Function</b>, which turns parameters and covariates into outcomes</li><li>A <b>systematic component</b> describing how parameters are set</li><li>A crucial <b>independence assumption</b> which lets us randomly generate outcomes one at a time</li></ul>"
DGP,intro,Observation Choice,Decide how much data you want to generate.
DGP,intro,Covariates,"The outcome variable of this DGP - Y - depends on its <b>covariates</b>. These are random variables that, with the parameters, combine into Y as described by the Probability Model. In this case, we\'ve generated the covariates randomly beforehand, according to various DGPs. Use the buttons to add or remove covariates."
DGP,intro,Parameters,"These sliders let you choose parameters. Depending on the DGP, these will directly control the shape of the distribution that you see in the <i>Analytical Plot</i>, or combine with the parameters first (as described in the Probability Model)."
DGP,intro,Analytical Plot,"<p>Here, you can see a graphical representation of the DGP you have set up, based on your choices of parameters and covariates. </p><p>This is a <b>density</b> or <b>mass</b> plot. It comes from the Probability Model - it isn\'t randomly generated! But if you randomly generated more and more data, the histogram of that data would look more and more like this. </p>"
DGP,intro,Ordinal Plot,The relative probability of each of the values as the chosen covariate changes.
DGP,intro,Parameter Histogram,"This plot describes the intermediate parameter, which is generated based on your parameters combined with the covariate."
DGP,intro,Functional Form,"The relationship between your chosen parameter and the rest of the parameters, with all the other parameters held at their means."
DGP,intro,Randomly Generated Data,"<p>Here is the data you\'ve generated from the DGP. Try changing parameters, and see how it changes.</p> <p>On the <i>Model</i> tab, we\'ll treat this data as if we don\'t know where it came from, and use it to learn about inference.</p>"
MLE,intro,Model Selection,"We can look at our data, or consult theory, and select a model that\'s our best guess of the true DGP. Maybe I\'ll guess that this data came from a Stylized Normal distribution. "
MLE,intro,Hypothesized Covariate,"Hypothesize a covariate. A researcher might hypothesize that some observed data - income - is attributable to one or more covariates - education, parents\' incomes, etc.  The covariates are generated randomly beforehand, according to various DGPs. Use the buttons to add or remove covariates."
MLE,intro,Statistical Model,"This is the statistical model, describing the family of models we chose. We\'re going to look at different parameter values - different members of this family - until we find the best fit."
MLE,intro,Guesstimate,"With this, you can approximate likelihood inference by hand. Try moving the sliders around until the green line (your DGP guess) matches the blue bars, as best as you can get."
MLE,intro,Reset ,Set the guesstimate to the Maximum Likelihood Estimates - the algorithmic best guess.
MLE,intro,byhand plot,"The guesstimate is going to be tough to get right, because the true DGP is a normal distribution. We\'re trying to fit a stylized normal distribution with the variance fixed at one. This sort of mistake is called <i>misspecification</i>"
MLE,intro,Likelihood,Now let\'s formalize our guessing process. We\'ve turned the statistical model into a likelihood function. We can use this to ask - which member of our family of DGPs is most likely to have generated our data?
MLE,intro,MLE plot,"This plot comes from the Log Likelihood function. It shows us the likelihood curve, which illustrates the relative likelihood of different values of the parameter &beta;."
MLE,intro,FFL plot,A plot of the functional form of our assumed DGP.
MLE,intro,Estimates,"The final output of our maximum likelihood estimation. The first part is a point estimate: our best guess for the real &beta;, given our assumed model. The second part is an estimate of uncertainty, reflecting how sure we are about that guess - were other values of &beta; nearly as likely?"
Sim,intro,Estimates (Sim),"Here\'s our starting point: the point estimates you made before, with an estimated uncertainty around them. "
Sim,intro,QOI picker,"Use this dropdown to choose a quantity of interest. Maybe I want to choose a value of X, and see what range of values of Y are possible; or maybe I want to guess what would happen if I re-drew this sample 1,000 times and plotted the estimates of &mu;."
Sim,intro,Sim X,"This slider lets you pick X. Before, we were using covariates to estimate our model. We have estimated the model. Maybe I estimated the relationship of vote share to advertising. Now I can ask, ""Given a certain level of advertising expenditure, how much vote share can I expect to gain - and how certain can I be about that?"""
Sim,intro,Sim Est Uncertainty,"There are two kinds of uncertainty to represent with simulation. The first is the <i>estimation uncertainty</i>. We\'re only observing a small sample of our population, or of the population of potential outcomes. How sure are we that our estimator is close to the true value?"
Sim,intro,Sim Fundamental Uncertainty,"The second type of uncertainty is <i>fundamental uncertainty</i>, representing the fact that the world is uncertain. Even if I got my parameter exactly right, I would only know how much my advertising spend would change my vote share in expectation. I can\'t predict whether it will rain in my best precincts, or if my opponents will pull out an October surprise. We simulate to represent those sort of surprises."
Sim,intro,QOI plot,"Here\'s the distribution of the quantity of interest you picked. The histogram represents the results of 1,000 simulations. In this case, it represents predicted values that Y can take on given the X you picked, and the estimation and fundamental uncertainty."
Sim,intro,FF plot,"This plot shows us one perspective on our estimation uncertainty. Given different covariate values, the line shows us the expected value of &mu;, and the band shows us the 80% confidence interval around the blue line. "
