#' Develop intuition for fundamental statistical concepts without
#' having to know any programming languages.
#'
#' \code{Gov2k1inSilico} is software that presents some of the most important
#' concepts in statistics (for social science). The app presents the idea of
#' probability distributions, describes the process of model-based inference,
#' and demonstrates simulation to derive quantities of interest.
#'
#' The software makes reference to the freely available lecture videos made by
#' Gary King for GOV 2001, Harvard's introductory graduate methodology class
#' for social scientists. \href{https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/gov2001}
