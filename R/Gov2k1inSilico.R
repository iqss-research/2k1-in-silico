#' \code{Gov2k1inSilico} is software that presents some of the most important
#' concepts in statistics (for social science). The app presents the idea of
#' probability distributions, describes the process of model-based inference,
#' and demonstrates simulation to derive quantities of interest.
#' The software makes reference to the freely available lecture videos made by
#' Gary King for \href{https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/gov2001}{GOV 2001}, Harvard's introductory graduate methodology class
#' for social scientists.
#'
#' See the \href{https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/2k1-in-silico/home}{project website}
