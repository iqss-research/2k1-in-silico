<h3 style="color:#9A2B35;">What is this?</h4>

<p style = "color:#474444;">2k1-in-Silico teaches statistics -- the big picture and the details -- without having to simultaneously learn or use a statistical programming language.  We focus on three concepts, each corresponding to its own tab (at the top of the screen):
<ul style = "padding-left:75px; padding-right:150px;color:#474444;">
  <li><b>Data Generation Processes:</b> how an assumed statistical model can produce data, based on the probability model of uncertainty;</li>
  <li><b>Likelihood:</b> the theory of statistical inference, which is almost the inverse of probability where we try to infer the data generation process from the observed data;</li>
  <li><b>Simulation:</b> enabling you (rather than some computer program) to completely control how statistical results are computed and presented, so you can understand your results and impactfully present them.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3 style="color:#9A2B35;">Why use it?</h4>

<p style = "color:#474444;">Learning while doing -- controlling inputs and watching how outputs change -- is more helpful than static textbooks, until now, programming lessons wind up interrupting learning (not much different than trying to take swimming lessons during calculus lectures). 2k1-in-Silico keeps learning interactive without requiring that you also find that bug on line 57. We also provide extensive and automated in-context assistance if, when, and where you need it (simply click on the little tooltips marked <b>i</b> whenever needed).</p>

<h3 style="color:#9A2B35;">Where can you find more information?</h4>

<p style = "color:#474444;"> Please see our paper “<a target="_blank" href="https://garyking.org/2k1">Statistical Intuition Without Coding (or Teachers)</a>”.  The paper and our app parallels some of the core, model-based content of <a target="_blank" href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/gov2001/">Gov 2001</a>, the first course in the Harvard Government Department's social science methods sequence (taught for many years by <a target="_blank" href="http://garyking.org">Gary King</a>). All the lectures, videos, and many other teaching materials, including this app, are available for other instructors and students to use in their courses as well from the course website, <a target="_blank" href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/gov2001/">j.mp/G2001</a>, many parts of which are linked to in the tooltips in the app. (Thanks to generations of Gov2001 students for helping us improve the ideas behind this app.) <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/qs2uCuDL2OQ?t=2416">This lecture video</a> gives an overview of the course.</p>
