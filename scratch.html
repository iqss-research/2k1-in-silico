<p>This is the Probability Model of this family of DGPs,
 describing how parameters become data.</p>
 <ul>
 <li>The first part is a <b>Probability Density Function</b>,
 which turns parameters(greek letters <span class="math inline">\\(\\beta, \\sigma, \\mu \\) etc.</span>) 
 and covariates (<span class="math inline">\\(X\\)</span>) into outcomes (<span class="math inline">\\(Y\\)</span>)</li>
 <li>The PDF represents the stochastic component of a <a href="https://youtu.be/qbxNf4iqJPo?t=143"><b>Statistical Model</b></a>.
 It also has a <b>systematic component</b> describing how parameters are set</li>
 </ul>
 <p>The Probability Model is described in depth in <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C7yRBfh2ok">this video</a>.</p>
