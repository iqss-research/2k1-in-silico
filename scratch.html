<h2>The Big Picture</h2>
<p>Much of empirical social science is based on statistical inference: the art of using what we can observe to learn about what we can\'t. 
This app will guide you through the intuition of inference without being distracted by having to learn a programming language.
The fundamental concepts of inference will help you understand the methods currently in use, as well as all the new methods that will be discovered over the 
course of your scientific career.</p>

<p>These fundamental concepts fall into three categories:</p>
<ul style = "padding-left:25px;">
<li><b>Data Generation Processes</b>, and how to represent them using the language of <b>Probability</b>;</li>
<li><b>Likelihood</b>, a framework for making inferences, and describing how certain we are about them;</li>
<li>and <b>Simulation</b>, a technique to extend specific inference results to broader implications about the world</li>
</ul>

<p>The app parallels core content of <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/gov2001/">Gov 2001</a>, Harvard\'s introductory quantitative methods class for political scientists.
If you want to go deeper into any of the concepts presented here, the app offers links to Gov 2001 lecture videos, slides, or other materials.
For example, <a href="https://youtu.be/qs2uCuDL2OQ?t=2416">this lecture video</a> presents the big picture of inference in greater detail.
